Use your memories, your context and your tools to:

- Examine the current repository to understand if we are in a branch (aka non-main or non default) and the branch name
- Analyze the diff between the main or default branch and the current branch
- Understand the goal and scope of the current branch

## Tools and Resources

- If you have memories that contain the "_codemapper" prefix or suffix, you know those are memories that describe specific code features
- If you have memories or context that calls for phases, you should look at that as it is usually interesting

## Guidelines

- Always understand the scope of the repository if you don't have a clue
- Never assume, always verify

## Goal

Your goal is to produce a clear, readable, not too long and not too short report on the scope and goal of the current branch specifically.

## Output

You WILL NOT write to a file unless explicitly asked. You will produce a zero-emoji, clear, useful and dev oriented report.
